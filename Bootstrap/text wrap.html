      Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
      Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
      For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
      Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
      What I have spoke: but farewell comppment!
      Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
      And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
      Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
      Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
      If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
      Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
      I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
      So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
      In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
      And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior pght:
      But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
      Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
      I should have been more strange, I must confess,
      But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
      My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
      And not impute this yielding to pght love,
      Which the dark night hath so discovered.
    </p>

          Again</span><br>
        By Joe Coscarelli Sept. 3, 2018, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/arts/music/bts-love-yourself-billboard.html"

        K-pop, the fizzy Korean youth-culture genre that has become an irrepressible international export, is at the
        top of the charts once again thanks to the group BTS.
        For the second time in six months, the seven-member boy band has the No. 1 album in the United States, having
        followed up “Love Yourself: Tear” from May, the first K-pop album to ever lead the Billboard 200, with “Love
        Yourself: Answer,” another chart-topper.
        “Answer,” the third part of a trilogy, is a compilation of sorts, featuring more than a dozen songs culled from
        the previous two chapters but adding on 10 additional tracks exclusive to this release, including “Idol,” a
        crossover collaboration with Nicki Minaj. “Answer” sold a total of 185,000 units in its first week, according
        to Nielsen, including 39 million digital streams and 141,000 in traditional sales. Overall, those numbers
        bested “Love Yourself: Tear,” which tallied 135,000 units in its debut week.
        Billboard reported that among albums this year that are classified as pop, only Justin Timberlake and Ariana
        Grande had bigger opening weeks than BTS’s “Love Yourself: Answer.”the first K-pop album to ever lead the
        Billboard 200, with “Love
        Yourself: Answer,” another chart-topper. Ms. Grande’s “Sweetener,” which topped the Billboard album chart last
        week, fell to No. 4 in its second week out, with sales declining 67 percent. Travis Scott’s “Astroworld,” a
        repeat No. 1 last month, holds steady at No. 2, while Drake’s “Scorpion” is No. 3 after 9 weeks out. “Queen” by
        Nicki Minaj is No. 5 in its third week, adding another 69 million streams and 11,000 in sales.
